# Iris_SVM
<b>Machine learning project for Irish Dataset using SVM for predictions.</b> 

><br/>The data has been taken from <i>Jaybrown lee</i> who has a clean Iris sepal length and width dataset. 

>The data is explored, described and visualised. The following machine learning algorithms were compared: 
<br/>LogisticRegression
<br/>LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
<br/>KNeighborsClassifier (K nearest neibhbour)
<br/>DecisionTreeClassifier
<br/>GaussianNB
<br/>SVC (Support Vector Classifier)

>K fold Cross validation technique has been applied.
<br/>SVC was found to have the highest accuracy of 98% and therefore is used to make predictions. 
<br/>Predictions are evaluated on their accuracy_score, confusion_matrix and classification_report.
